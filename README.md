# MDR-Issues
Public Player Issues Page for Meadow Riders
## Rules for reporting an issue (or idea)
1. No phone-recorded media is allowed, you do realize that we have video recorders?
   * wf-recorder for Wayland;
   * OBS Studio for X11;
   * OBS Studio for Windows;
   * OBS Sudio for Mac
2. No phone screenshots of the game, again, we have screenshot tools.
   * Grim for Wayland;
   * Flameshot/KSnip/Maim for X11;
   * Snipping tool for Windows;
   * Screenshot for Mac
3. Make sure your issue (or idea) hasn't already been reported.
4. Only English is allowed.
## Warning
While build-support for Mac may be provided, we don't test those versions (due to nobody being on a Mac, duh). So if you find any issues relating to it, you have to describe in clear detail what happened and how to reproduce the issue.

Windows is also supported, and is tested by the testers before release. Do note though that no actual Windows testing is usually done by the developers, most of the focus goes to Linux because it's a superior platform (X11; Wayland), and because it offers overall better performance in most cases on Meadow Riders.
